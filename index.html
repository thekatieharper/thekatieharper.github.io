      <h1>Katie Harper</h1>

<p>I’ve spent the last decade scaling venture-backed startups in operations roles, bringing order to early-stage chaos. I now apply those same skills to the defense ecosystem as VP of Product & Partnerships at <a href="https://smallbcc.com/" target="_blank"><strong>SBCC</strong></a>, growing the company’s network and supporting national security efforts. Previously, I served as the COO of <a href="https://getkard.com" target="_blank">Kard</a>, where I helped grow the company from $0 to ~$10M annual revenue by standing up partnerships, scaling internal infrastructure, and building out teams. Before that, I was Head of Operations at <a href="https://www.upwave.com/" target="_blank">Upwave</a>, leading a small team and helping the company scale from seed through Series B.</p>

<p>I studied computer science and Russian at Duke, where I now stay involved as a mentor in the entrepreneurship community. After living in both New York and San Francisco, I currently call Florida home.</p>

<h2>Current Projects</h2>

<p><a href="https://smallbcc.com/" target="_blank"><strong>SBCC</strong></a>: Serving as the VP of Product and Partnership, I'm focused on building a platform making it easier to find, fund, and transition new defense tech into the hands of warfighters. 

<p><a href="http://reissued.studio/" target="_blank"><strong>REISSUED</strong></a>:
Doing behind-the-scenes magic to support my brother’s growing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@reissued_" target="_blank"><strong>YouTube channel</strong></a> focused on finding and 'reissuing' thrifted finds with incredible design.</p>

<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/chad-zessin-designs" target="_blank"><strong>Chad Zessin Designs</strong></a>:
My boyfriend builds incredible pieces in sinker cypress, so I built something small to showcase his work.</p>

<p><strong>Patriot Primer</strong> (coming soon):
A running list of resources I use to keep learning and tracking what’s happening in defense.</p>
