      <h1>Katie Harper</h1>

<p>I’ve spent the last decade scaling venture-backed startups in operations roles, bringing order to early-stage chaos. Most recently, I served as the COO of <a href="https://getkard.com" target="_blank">Kard</a>, where I helped grow the company from $0 to ~$10M ARR by standing up partnerships, scaling internal infrastructure, and building out teams. Before that, I was Head of Operations at <a href="https://www.upwave.com/" target="_blank">Upwave</a>, leading a small team and helping the company scale from seed through Series B.</p>

<p>I studied computer science and Russian at Duke, where I now stay involved as a mentor in the entrepreneurship community. After living in both New York and San Francisco, I currently call Florida home.</p>

<h2>How I Can Help</h2>

<p><em>Operations.</em> Whether you’re making your first ops hire or scaling a messy human-in-the-loop system, I like fixing what’s breaking and building what’s missing.</p>
<p><em>Hiring and team design.</em> Especially for your first key roles: who to hire, how to run the process, and when to level up.</p>
<p><em>Early-stage GTM.</em> I can help clarify your first customer motion, organize a scrappy sales process, and set up feedback loops.</p>
<p><em>Internal systems.</em> Meeting rhythms, metrics, documentation. I’ll guide you on how to build scaffolding that keeps things moving.</p>
<p><em>Career clarity.</em> I like listening to people in transition and talking through what could come next.</p>

<h2>Current Projects</h2>

<p>Is your company next? If you’re building something early-stage and want help making it make sense, I’d love to hear about it.</p>
